2008-10-13 Version 1.0 released

	This is the first stable release of LEMON. Compared to the 0.x

          Migration Guide in the doc for more details)
          * Graph -> Digraph, UGraph -> Graph
          * Edge -> Arc, UEdge -> Edge
	  * source(UEdge)/target(UEdge) -> u(Edge)/v(Edge)
	* Other improvements
	  * Better documentation
	  * Reviewed and cleaned up codebase
	  * CMake based build system (along with the autotools based one)
	* Contents of the library (ported from 0.x)
	  * Algorithms
